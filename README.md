# Bastic Encryption Models

In thit project we have created a simple neon/cyberpunk page to test out some common encryption models, those being Caesar Cipher, RSA public/privat key and Hashin

The page uses flask to create a simple user-face for demonstation

## Caesar Cipher

## RSA Public/Privat key

## Hashing
